# GitHubTutorial

### This is the GitHub tutorial was presented at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee in March 2021.
The tutorial goes through some basic git commands that will help you get started with making and committing changes to your first git repository. It contains a step-by-step guide to some of the features in git that I have found most helpful while coding!

To follow this tutorial you will have to:
- Make an account on Github.com
- Download command-line tools for Git on your local machine (see [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for instructions on how to do this)
- You can either click on the powerpoint presentation in my repository and download it so you can view it in presentation mode on your computer **OR** you can fork and clone this repository on your machine (sorry, these terms may not make much sense at the moment!). To use this second option:
  * Go to https://github.com/mrinmayik/GitHubTutorial, and click "Fork" in the top right of the page. This will make a copy of my repository in your own Github account. Any changes you make in the files in this repo will NOT affect the files in my Github account, so go nuts! :)
  * Go into this repository, click on the green button "Code", copy the repository link that pops up. Then go into your terminal and type 
``` git clone <Link_That_You_Copied>```

#### GitHubTutorial_Steps.txt
This text file contains the git commands that you can copy and paste into your terminal while you are in the repository folder. This text file also contains some explanations of what action each command will perform

#### GitHubTutorial_Presentation.pptx
The powerpoint file  contains a pictoral representation of the steps in the tutorial. Since git & github use such peculiar jargon, it is often helpful to visualise the effect of each command, before trying it out on the command line. 
GitHubTutorial_Steps.txt contains references to the slide numbers from the powerpoint presentation so you can execute a command on the command line, and visualise the command in the presentation.


This tutorial is, admittedly, limited. I have covered the basic git operations that were most confusing to me when I first got started. I will update this tutorial as I learn more git functionality. In the meanwhile, feel free to leave your questions and suggestions in the comments in the repository! Happy Gitt-ing! :)
